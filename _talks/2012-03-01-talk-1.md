At the **International Conference on Optimization and Learning (OLA 2025)**, I presented our paper on addressing the **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)** challenge in Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning.  

Our work investigates two complementary approaches:  
- **Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes (BO-GP)**, which is efficient in leveraging prior knowledge but limited by its sequential nature.  
- **Partition-Based Optimization (PBO)**, which enables massive parallelization but requires more evaluations to converge.  

By combining their strengths, we proposed a **hybrid BO-PBO algorithm**, paving the way for scalable optimization methods tailored to expensive objective functions in exascale computing environments.
