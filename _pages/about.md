Hello! I'm Nathan Davouse, a PhD student specializing in Operations Research. My thesis is about **ecological and economic logistics service network design**, under the supervision of *Frédéric Semet* and *Diego Cattaruzza* along the guidance of *Gaël Guillot*. This work is funded by La Poste, to deal with the network design of their B2B logistics providers, Log'issimo.

Previously, I earned an engineering degree in *Industrial Engineering* and a master's degree in *System Operation and Safety*, both from the University of Technology of Troyes (UTT), where I attended the engineering school.

I am passionate about combining environmental responsibility with efficient logistics and safety in complex systems.
