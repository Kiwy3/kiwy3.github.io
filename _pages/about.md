Hello! I'm Nathan Davouse, a PhD student specializing in Operations Research. My research focuses on **ecological and economic logistics service network design**, developing models and decision support algorithms to optimize sustainable logistics systems.

Previously, I earned an engineering degree in *Industrial Engineering* and a master's degree in *System Operation and Safety*, both from the University of Technology of Troyes (UTT), where I attended the engineering school.

I am passionate about combining environmental responsibility with efficient logistics and safety in complex systems.
